# MISRA Rules Applied in This  TIMER Driver (using TIMER0)
-Rule 14.7, requires that functions with variable-length argument lists should not be called.<br>
-Rule 18.1, requires that all declarations should be at the top of the function or file scope.<br>
-Rule 10.1, requires that all operands of logical and relational operators should have a Boolean type.<br>
-Rule 17.4, prohibits the use of the comma operator.<br>
-Rule 13.2, which requires that all conditional statements should have a Boolean expression as the controlling expression.<br>
-Rule 12.2, which requires that all switch statements should have a default case.
